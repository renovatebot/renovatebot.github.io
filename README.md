# docs.renovatebot.com

This repository is used to build Renovate's docs site (https://docs.renovatebot.com).

The content itself is pulled from https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate, so you should raise PRs to that repository if you need to update the content that's displayed.

The website is built and hosted by GitHub Pages.

To build locally, run `make` and then `make serve`.
