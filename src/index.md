## The Renovate Approach

We believe everyone benefits from automation, whether it's a little or a lot.
This means that Renovate:

- Adapts to your workflow
- Allows you to configure its behavior
- Will autodetect settings where possible

## Renovate's Purpose

We created Renovate to tackle the problem of out-of-date dependencies in software projects.

Most projects start with up-to-date dependencies, but fall behind over time.
This means:

- Missing out on bug fixes or new features
- Getting further into "technical debt"
- Increasing the time needed to fix vulnerabilities

Renovate allows projects to get, and stay, up-to-date.
Developers can use the saved time on more important duties.
