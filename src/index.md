# Renovate documentation

Renovate is an Open Source tool to automate:

- Detecting dependencies in a repository (Open Source and private/closed source)
- Checking if there are dependency updates
- Creating commits and Merge/Pull Requests to update dependencies
- Showing the release notes

## Renovate's purpose

We created Renovate to tackle the problem of out-of-date dependencies in software projects.

Most projects start with up-to-date dependencies, but fall behind over time.
This means:

- Missing out on bug fixes or new features
- Getting further into "technical debt"
- Decreasing the time needed to fix vulnerabilities

Renovate allows projects to get, and stay, up-to-date.
Developers can use the saved time on more important duties.

## Ways to run Renovate

You can run Renovate as:

- an [Open Source npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/renovate)
- a [pre-built Open Source image on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/renovate/renovate)
- a [free GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/renovate) that is hosted by WhiteSource
