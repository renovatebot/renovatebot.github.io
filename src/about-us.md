# About us

Renovate was created by [WhiteSource](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/) staff and they continue to work on Renovate.

More than 500 outside contributors helped improve Renovate.

## Renovate development

The source code for Renovate is available on GitHub ([renovatebot/renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate)).
This is where we do most of the development.

## About these docs

The Renovate docs are built from Markdown files in [Renovate's Open Source repos](https://github.com/renovatebot/).
Most of the source files can be found in the [main Renovate repository](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/tree/main/docs/usage).
