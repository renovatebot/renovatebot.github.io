<p>If you're using the GitHub-hosted app version of Renovate, <em>and</em> you invited the <code>renovate</code> npm user into your npm organization then keep reading this message.</p>

<p>
  We are phasing out using the <code>renovate</code> npm user for private packages.
  We are deliberately skipping provisioning this npm token for 20 percent of the time (brownout).
  This means that Renovate will autoclose some pull requests, which will then be re-opened the next time Renovate runs with the token.
</p>

<p>
  If you're seeing this behavior, it means you need to set up your own service user token.
  Read <a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/20613" target="_blank">discussion 20613 on the Renovate repository</a> to learn more.
