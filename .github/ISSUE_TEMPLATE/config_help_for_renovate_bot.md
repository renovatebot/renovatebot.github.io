Stop!

Configuration help questions for Renovate are very welcome!
However, please don't create a new issue.
Instead use the [discussions tab](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions) on the `renovatebot/renovate` repository.

Search the discussions forum to see if your config question is already answered.
If not, create a new "config help" discussions post to get help from the Renovate team.
